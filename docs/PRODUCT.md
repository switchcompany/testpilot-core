# Forge Core — Product Overview

## The Problem

Backend teams spend **30-40% of development time** writing and maintaining unit tests. Most projects have:
- Incomplete coverage (industry average: 40-60%)
- Fragile tests that break with every refactor
- No consistent testing patterns across the team
- Knowledge silos — only the author understands the test

## The Solution

**Forge Core** is an AI agent that acts as a **dedicated test engineer on your team**. Drop it into any backend project, and it:

1. **Analyzes** your architecture (HLD, LLD, dependency chains)
2. **Generates** idiomatic unit tests in your project's style
3. **Iterates** until 90%+ coverage is achieved
4. **Learns** from every project, getting smarter over time

### Zero Risk Guarantee
- ✅ Never modifies production code
- ✅ Never deletes existing tests
- ✅ Automatic rollback if coverage drops
- ✅ No secrets or proprietary code stored

## What You Get

### For Developers
- **Hours saved**: Typical project goes from 0% → 85%+ coverage in one run
- **Quality tests**: Not boilerplate — tests that actually catch bugs
- **Consistent patterns**: Same testing conventions across all services
- **Edge case coverage**: Null inputs, error paths, boundary conditions, concurrency
- **Speed**: Parallel generation, smart batching — enterprise projects in under 45 minutes
- **Zero babysitting**: Auto compile-fix loop means you walk away and come back to results

### For Engineering Managers
- **Measurable coverage gains**: Before/after reports for every run
- **Team-wide knowledge**: Patterns learned on one project help all projects
- **Reduced review cycles**: Well-structured tests pass PR review faster
- **Compliance ready**: Coverage reports for audit requirements

### For CTOs
- **ROI**: A single test engineer costs $120K-180K/year. Forge Core delivers comparable output at a fraction of the cost
- **Scalability**: Works across all your backend services simultaneously
- **Vendor-agnostic**: Supports 9+ languages — no stack lock-in
- **Data privacy**: Runs in your environment, nothing leaves your infrastructure

### Workflow Phases

| # | Phase | Duration | Output |
|---|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Stack Detection | ~30s | Language, framework, test tools identified |
| 1.5 | Exclusion Scan | ~15s | Coverage exclusion map and included packages |
| 2 | Architecture Analysis | ~2min | HLD/LLD, dependency map, flow documentation |
| 2.5 | Cascade Analysis | ~1min | Dependency graph, cascade map, Tier 1/2/3 targets |
| 3 | Existing Test Audit | ~1min | Baseline coverage, gap analysis, quality score |
| 4 | Test Generation (iterative) | ~15-25min | New test files with 90%+ coverage |
| 5 | Final Report | ~30s | Before/after metrics, files created, remaining gaps |
| 6 | Knowledge Capture | ~30s | New patterns saved for future projects |

**Total time: ~20-30 minutes** (vs. 2-4 weeks manually)

## FAQ

**Q: Does it work with monorepos?**
A: Yes. Forge Core detects monorepo structures and can target specific modules.

**Q: Will it break my existing tests?**
A: No. It never deletes existing tests and has rollback protection if coverage drops.

**Q: Does it need access to my source code?**
A: It runs locally in your environment via GitHub Copilot. No code leaves your infrastructure.

**Q: How is this different from Copilot's built-in test generation?**
A: Copilot generates tests for individual functions. Forge Core understands your entire architecture, iterates for coverage, handles complex mocking, and learns from every project.

**Q: Can it generate integration tests?**
A: The current focus is unit tests. Integration and E2E test generation is on the roadmap.
